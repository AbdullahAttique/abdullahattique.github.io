                        <br>
                        <p>Developed in Unity for the exploration of game mechanics involving a physics based interactive environment as well as to play around with design.
                            features include platforms that can be pushed by the player, these platforms could be inter-connected 
                            (pushing one platform downwards may inversely push another platform upwards like radio buttons). 
                            Objects could also be picked up and used to affect such platforms and environmental features such as by weighting down platforms or holding things in place.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>These ideas could have use in puzzle games or stages, having the user heavily influence the world in a relatively
                            tactile manner.
                        </p>

                        <p>The player can pick up and move around certain objects.</p>

                        <p>Objects can be placed to affect the world, such  as weighing down a platform that would bring up another connected platform up.</p>

                        <p>The idea can be extended to manipulate the world in more elaborate ways. For example, the image above shows a number of objects arranged to weigh down one of the inter-connected platforms just enough to form a staircase</p>
